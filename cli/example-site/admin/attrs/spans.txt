# NOTE: This hasn't been implemented yet
#
# GOAL: This file is use to define which attributes
# show up under ``attrs`` and ``custom_attrs``
# in spans. Anything here will show up under
# ``attrs``. Anything that's not in this file
# shows up under ``custom_attrs``. The reason
# for this is to make use of ``.attrs_string``
# in spans to output all the ``attrs``
# directly. 
#
# TODO: Add this functionality
