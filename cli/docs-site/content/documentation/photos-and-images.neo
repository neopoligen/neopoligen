Photos And Images

There are two sections in the default
theme called ``-- image`` and ``-- photo``

The ``-- image`` section is for outputting
a basic image. The ``-- photo`` section
wraps the image in a ``<div>|html`` with 
a ``class="photo"|html`` attribute which
is set up with a corresponding style
in the css.
