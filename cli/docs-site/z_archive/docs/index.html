Neopoligen

Neopoligen is a free website builder. It&#x27;s goal is  
to make it easy to get started even if you&#x27;ve never
made a site before. 

There&#x27;s a lot of features built into the app. You can 
start making content in the default theme as soon as 
you install it. You can also customize everything.
From changing font colors all the way to creating 
the most complicated site you can think if, Neopoligen 
provides the foundation to make whatever you want on 
the web. 

-- h2

How It Works

You make content for your site by making files on your 
computer that look like this: 

-- code&#x2f;
-- neo

-- title
-- subtitle: Websites For Everyone

Neopoligen

Neopoligen is a free website builder. It&#x27;s goal is  
to make it easy to get started even if you&#x27;ve never
made a site before. 

-- &#x2f;code

Neopoligen combines those files with 
themes to make a preview version of your site
on your computer. Once you have things the way
you want them you can use a free service to share it 
with the world. 

-- h2

Your Content, Your Site, Forever

You can think about websites as being made up of three
parts:

-- list

- The &lt;&lt;em|Content&gt;&gt; that makes up the site

- The &lt;&lt;em|Domain Name&gt;&gt; which is used for the site&#x27;s address (e.g. &lt;&lt;em|neopoligen.com&gt;&gt;)

- The &lt;&lt;em|Host Service&gt;&gt; that sends the site Content to your
browser when you visit the site&#x27;s Domain Name address

-- p

When you use TikTok, Instagram, Twitter&#x2f;X, Facebook, etc...
that distinction vanishes. Your Content gets locked behind 
their company Domain Names and Host Services. Neopoligen doesn&#x27;t work 
that way. It generates the Content for your site on your 
computer. You choose your Domain Name and Host Service independently. 
When you&#x27;re ready to make your site visible to the world, Neopoligen
sends a copy of it to the Host Service which connects it to 
your chosen Domain Name. The original always stays with you.

And, here&#x27;s the key part: by keeping the parts separate you&#x27;re 
free to change your Host Services without losing all your stuff. 

-- h3

Domain Names

Neopoligen sites work with a variety of Host Services including
some free ones. For example, Neopoligen works with the
free Host Service provided by a named GitHub (which 
you can learn how to use here: &lt;&lt;tlink|2dpxfosc&gt;&gt;)

GitHub&#x27;s Host Service and others like it start you
off with a free Domain Name like:

alanwsmith.github.io

That&#x27;s a great start, but it&#x27;s important to point out
that the Host Service owns those Domain Names which ties
you back to them (e.g. I can&#x27;t move &lt;&lt;em|alanwsmith.github.io&gt;&gt;
to another Host Service besides GitHub).

That&#x27;s not a problem as long as you&#x27;re aware of it. The
main thing to know is that if you decide to change Host 
Services you&#x27;ll lose the Domain Name and have to pick a 
new one. You won&#x27;t lose any content though. It&#x27;ll still 
all be on your computer ready for Neopoligen to send to 
whoever you choose for your new Host Service.

Your Own Domain Name

-- aside

This section is about setting up your own Domain Name. 
Unfortunately, doing so is not free. Prices vary depending
on the name and average around $15-20&#x2f;year. 

I want to make it clear that getting and using your own
Domain Name is completely optional. If you have any 
hesitation about spending the money, skip it for now 
and just go straight to the &lt;&lt;ilink: 2dqqynua|Quick Start Guide&gt;&gt;.
It will get you set up with a a completely free website
in about TKTKTK minutes. You can always come back
and switch to your own Domain Name later.

-- p

If you can afford it, my recommendation is to purchase your 
own Domain Name. This gives you complete control over your 
site since you can change Host Services without changing the 
Domain Name. More importantly, it protects your site from things like 
the Host Service canceling their service or going out 
of business.

For example, if GitHub ever decides to stop providing 
Host Services I&#x27;d lose &lt;&lt;em|alanwsmith.github.io&gt;&gt; with no
way to get it back. But, I use my own &lt;&lt;em|alanwsmith.com&gt;&gt;
domain for my personal site. So, if my current Host Service goes 
away for some reason I would just pick a new one and set up
Neopoligen to send my site there. 

The other nice thing about having your own Domain Name
is branding. For example, I like being able to tell folks to visit:

&lt;&lt;strong|alanwsmith.com&gt;&gt; 

better than 

&lt;&lt;strong|alanwsmith.github.io&gt;&gt;
