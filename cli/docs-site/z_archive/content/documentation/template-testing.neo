Template Testing

TODO write up how template testing works TKTKTKT

Example template:

-- pre/

-- title

This is a test of the title

-- expected-output

<section>...This is a test of the title...</section>

(NOTE: this needs to actually be filled out, but the idea
is to drop in the expected html output)
