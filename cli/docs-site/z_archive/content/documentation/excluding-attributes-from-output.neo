Excluding Section Attributes From Output

-- notes

- For things like `-- forward`` and `-- title`` that
should be made visible in the output via the 
template instead of automatically being included
as HTML attributes inside the parent elements

- The list is defined in the `includes/macros.jinja``
file in the `section_attributes`` macro which is
what determines the values that get output
