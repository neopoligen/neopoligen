Multi-Line Attributes 

For things that have longer attribute needs (like
image alt tags) the attribute can be added multiple 
times. They all get combined (with a space in-between)

For example, here's a list section where the 
title is split across three

-- list
-- title: alfa
-- title: bravo
-- title: charlie

- check item one

-- list
-- title: Use Case

- Long image alt tags
