TODO: JavaScript Examples 

Scripts can be set up as examples that show on 
the page as well as being added to the head of
the document. This is designed to make sure that
any examples actually work because what's shown
on the page is that actual code that's being run.

-- script
-- template: show
-- class: example

console.log("here")
