Includes (templates) 

-- list

- MiniJinja templates can call other templates. I keep 
things like `global_nav.jinja`` in an `includes`` 
directory inside the primary templates folder. 

- They can be placed anywhere though.

- The included files have the full context of the 
parent template (i.e. access to the `site``, `page``, 
and `functions`` objects)
