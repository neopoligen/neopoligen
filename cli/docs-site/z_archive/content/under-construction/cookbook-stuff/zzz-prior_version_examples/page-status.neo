Page Statuses

The `-- status`` in the `-- metadata`` attribute defines
the status for the page. The status is combined with
the `-- type`` attribute to determined the template
to use to render the page. 

For example, this page is defined as a draft so
that template is used which is what's putting 
the "Draft" watermark on it
