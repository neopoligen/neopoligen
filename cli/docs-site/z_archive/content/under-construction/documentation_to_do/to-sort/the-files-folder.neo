The files Folder

-- notes
-- title: Quick Notes

- The files folder sits directly inside a 
site's main folder. It's next to "docs"
and "content", etc...

- Any files placed in the folder are 
copied to the "docs" directory without
any alteration

For example, putting a file called "my-styles.css" inside
the "files" folder makes it available at:

www.your-site.com/my-styles.css
