NOTE: This feature was rejected in favor of going
with exact matches from start to finish
every time which is easier to reason about.

Theme Test Exclude Content In Test


-- h2
-- class: strike

Overview

The searches in theme tests can be negated. That is, 
you put in a string that you want to make sure
_does not__ show up in the output. This is done
by added `exclude = true`` to the top of the 
file before the "INPUT:" line.

-- title: Requirements

[] Adding `exclude = true`` to the top of a 
theme test before the `INPUT:`` line negates the
test so that if a `TARGET:`` _does not__ match
the test passes (and if the `TARGET:`` _does__
match, the test fails)


-- notes
-- class: strike

- The `exclude`` setting affects all the `TARGET``
matchers in the file. That is, you can't have
a single file that does both regular matches
and excludes at the same time. Testing both
ways is done by making two test files.
