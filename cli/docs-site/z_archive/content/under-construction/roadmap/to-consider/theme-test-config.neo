Theme Testing Config Front Matter

-- h2

Overview

Theme tests can be configured by adding 
"toml" data before the INPUT section. 

The initial use case is to pass an 
`ignore`` flag to prevent the test
from being run

The second case is to add a `solo``
flag that, when found, will cause only
tests with `solo`` in them to be run
