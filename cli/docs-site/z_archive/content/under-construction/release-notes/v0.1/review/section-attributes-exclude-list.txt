Section Attributes Exclude List

-- h2

Overview

The `{%- set section_attribute_excludes = [] -%}`` in 
`SITE/configuration/globals/jinja`` to defines a list of section
attributes to exclude when outputting the `<section>`` HTML tag.

For example, the default templates support outputting content
directly from `-- forward``, `-- preface``, and `-- afterword``
sections. This is what prevents them from showing up in the
`<section>`` as well (e.g. you get `<section>`` instead of
`<section preface="lorem ipsum">``

-- warning

Don't use "section_attribute_excludes" for any 
security related or sensitive storage needs. For example, 
don't store passwords in attributes and then
exclude the attribute in the configuration file. Neopoligen
is not designed for secure storage and should not be
used in that way.
