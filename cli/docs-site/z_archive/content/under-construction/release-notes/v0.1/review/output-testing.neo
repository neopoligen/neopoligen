Output Testing

-- aside

This is current off during a refactor

-- h2

Overview

Output testing is done by creating files
in a "tests" folder. The name of each
file is "NAME-ID.txt" where "NAME" is
a name to help identify the tests the 
file contains and "ID" is the
page id of the content file to run
the test against.

For example, I put tests for the home 
page of this site in:

`home-page-2ck33evh.txt``

Tests are defined by writing strings
to look for. 

Individual tests are separated by lines
with five tildes (i.e. `~~~~~``)

Spaces and line breaks aren't taken into
account during the matching. This prevents
issues with tabs and spaces causing false
errors

Any errors are printed to the command
line when the process runs

-- title: Requirements

[x] Load test files when process starts

[x] Run each test when the page output
is generated and before it's written out
(this makes it easier test pages that
have custom paths via their IDs)

[x] If a page fails a test still output
it, but log the error


-- notes

- All tests for a given page must be
in the same test file. If you make 
multiple test files pointing to the
same ID only one of them will get run
