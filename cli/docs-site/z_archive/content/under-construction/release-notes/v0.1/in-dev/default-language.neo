Default Language

-- h2

Overview

Neopoligen has been designed with internationalization
and localization in mind. The initial feature
defines a "SITE_FOLDER/configuration/general/default-language.txt"
file that holds the language code to use by default. 
Any content pages that don't have an explicit path
set in their metadata are generated under a
folder with that name. 

Supporting the output of multiple languages is
still in the design phase. By starting with the default
language those features will be able to 
be added with a minimal amount of impact
on the existing content.

-- title: Requirements

[x] The language code is defined in the
"SITE_FOLDER/configuration/general/default-language.txt" 
file

[x] The language code is used to define the 
folder for any page content that doesn't have
and explicit path set in its metadata

[x] If a file with page content has an 
explicit path defined it's used without
any alteration to add the language folder
to its path

[x] The content in the "files" folder is
not effected by the default language. Responsibility 
for changing paths for internationalization/localization 
in that folder lies with the content owner
