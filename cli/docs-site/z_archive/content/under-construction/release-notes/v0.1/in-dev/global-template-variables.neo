Global Template Variables

-- h2

Overview

Neopoligen is designed with a clean separation 
between the content and the templates that
output the site. Anything that can be contained
in one place or the other is moved into
the appropriate place. There are some items
that need to span between the content and
the theme templates. Those values are defined
in files contained in the `SITE_FOLDER/configuration/`` 
folder. They are assembled into a global
variables that are made available in the templates.

This allows for things like defining the default
language and which attributes should and 
should not appear in the HTML output tags.
