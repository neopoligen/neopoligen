Standard Error Output Convention

-- h2

Overview

If a recoverable error occurs in a 
template macro the standard response
should be to output:

-- pre/

~e~

-- /pre

That makes it easier to see that something
went wrong when authoring content or 
adjusting templates without publishing 
a full error message (which should be
handled via logging)

-- note
-- title: Requirements

This is a convention. It's up to
each macro to implement as part
of their requirements
