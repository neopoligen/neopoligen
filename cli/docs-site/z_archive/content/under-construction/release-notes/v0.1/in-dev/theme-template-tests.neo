Theme Template Tests

-- h2

Overview

Theme templates tests provide a way to verify the 
expected output from a theme actually shows up. 

-- todo
-- title: Requirements


[x] Test ".neo" files go in the "tests" dir for 
the theme

[x] Each file in the directory produces a site with 
a page based on the "INPUT:" section of the file

[x] The INPUT is run through the templates to produce
an output string that's used for comparison of
"TARGET" strings. 

[x] All spaces, tabs, and newlines are removed from
the generated and target strings to avoid errors
that are nothing but empty space

[x] Once the spaces, tabs, and newlines are removed the
output and the target must match exactly starting
at the start and going all the way to the end (i.e.
you can't match just the middle part of content)

[x] In addition to the page generated from the test file
a few other pages are automatically included in the site
as well. They can be used for testing links and 
functionality on other pages. See <<tlink|2cyfahqv>> 
for details

[] Templates for tests can be added to a folder inside
the themes directory so they can be run without having
to put them in the content folder

-- notes
-- title: Notes

- These tests ignore spaces, tabs, and newlines. 
If something requires validating those another
test method must be used.

- To make the exact matching easier I created
an "empty" page type template. The only thing
it outputs is the title and main body of the 
page. That way there's not a of other things
that might change floating around
