DESCRIPTION:

This checks to make sure that calling "title" in the
template doesn't output anything if there's not
a title section in the source file

This test won't function until "full_match" 
functionality is in place which ensures
that stuff not shown in the match will 
fail if it shows up

INPUT:

-- p

There is no title section above this paragraph

    <p>There is no title section above this paragraph</p>
  </div>
</section>
