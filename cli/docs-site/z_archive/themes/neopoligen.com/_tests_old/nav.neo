DESCRIPTION:

[x] This is the baseline test for the 
basic-nav json section

[x] The first item is for the page itself which
demonstrates how only text is shown instead
of turning it into a link

[x] The second item doesn't have any filters
associated with it so it shows up as 
a link

[x] The third shows general 
behavior when outputting to something that's
not the current page and when no filters
match. In that case, the text is turned into
a link

[x] The fourth item has a filter which matches
the type defined in the page (i.e. "test-sample-type-2")
which turns off the link and outputs only text. 
This is used for things like global navigation
when the top level page link is designed to be
off when in a section

[x] The fifth item shows an optional title being
used instead of the title from the page itself
