Hello and Welcome!  

Hi, I'm Alan. 

I've been running my site for a couple decades.
There's a bunch here, but you caught me in the middle of 
rebuilding it. To start, here's a few hand-picked posts
that'll give you an idea of what I'm about. Below
are all the posts on the site reverse-chronologically. 
They're split into Published, Drafts, and Scratch Notes
depending on how complete they are.

-- title: links

- <<link|Photoshop and Lightroom get alt text editing|/en/2h4ynhnr>> - This 
is great. You can now add and edit image alt text directly in photoshop and lightroom.
If we can get the social networks on board this will be a huge benefit to folks
who use assistive tech.

- <<link|The Clicky Sound|/en/20en9sxu/?the-clicky-sound>> - I discovered I have bipolar disorder 
at the end of 2017. It started with a manic episode that sent me to the psych 
ward. It was followed by two years of bipolar depression that landed me back there for
my own safety. This is the first thing I wrote when I was finally 
recovered enough to start making things again. 



- <<link|How Computers Work: The 1s And 0s|/en/20en8mvx/>> - 
Starting with a light switch, this post shows the basics of
how computers work. It all comes down to __1s__ and __0s__

- <<link|How To Grow Your Digital Garden With Sub-Domains|/en/28dakarf/?how-to-grow-your-digital-garden-with-subdomains>> -
I was struggling with my website. I kept wanting to do things, but
the framework I was using added so much friction I rarely
made progress. Then, I had an idea. What about sub-domains...


- <<link|Thoughts On Digital Gardens In 2024|/en/2gmkhvfr/>> - 
A big part of the reason I wrote my own website builder was
to make it easier to experiment with my site. I don't tend
to think of it as a "digital garden" these days, but I still
like the term and it's a good framing for thinking about 
the work that goes into a site

- <<link|My links page|https://links.alanwsmith.com/>> - this
is a collection of projects I've worked on in the past. Most
of the projects are built on sub-domains which I was using for
my digital garden a few years ago. (The goal is to get most things
moved here over time now that I have a website builder
that's easier to use)

Right now, the main thing I'm working on is <<ilink|my color

In Progress

Before we get to the mass link list, here's some of what I've 
been working on recently:

ASCIIShop

This is the tool I built to make an animated
ASCII Art avatar for streaming on Twitch.

Neopolitan

The biggest thing I've been working on over the past year is
a new plain-text format called neopolitan. Inspired by 
markdown, mdx, org-mode, and the rest, it's designed to manage 
the content for my site. I'm using it full time and couldn't be
happier. 

You can <<link|learn more about it here|/neopolitan/>>

Neopoligen

The static site generator I built for neopolitan is called called neopoligen. 
I don't really have a page for it yet, but the
<<link|source code is here|https://github.com/alanwsmith/neopoligen>> 
if you'd like to take a peak.

Tree-Sitter Syntax Highlighting

With one exception, neopolitan doesn't need much of a 
syntax highlighter. That exception is embedded code blocks
of another language. Seeing native syntax highlighting
is a huge quality-of-life improvement. Even for the smallest
of samples. 

I've got a solid start on a Tree-sitter parser to 
add neopolitan (and embedded language) highlighting
to Neovim. It took learning a little "C", but it's been
worth it. 

You can <<link|see an example here|/tree-sitter-neopolitan/index.html>>

Grimoire Code Block Execution

I call my notes app my Grimoire. There's no magic in computers, 
but there's a lot that's magical. I love the idea of 
naming my collection of incantations in that light. 

I used to use emacs org-mode for my grimoire primarily because 
of it's ability to run code blocks inside notes directly. Think
Jupyter Notebooks, but in plain-text and for any language.
I ended up moving back to Neovim full time but didn't want to 
give that functionality. So, I'm working on a prototype. 

I've got the basics working. The results for the code
block below were generated automatically inside the file.

Details for that will go in the tree-sitter link when
I get things updated

Search 

This is a test run with <<link|pagefind search|https://pagefind.app/docs/>>

-- comment

<link href="/pagefind/pagefind-ui.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="/pagefind/pagefind-ui.js"></script>
<div id="search"></div>
<script>
    window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
        new PagefindUI({ element: "#search", showSubResults: true });
    });
</script>
