Getting Started With Neopoligen

Neopoligen is a website builder designed 
with the goal of making it as easy as 
possible for anyone to make their own 
website for free. It uses files you 
write on your computer that look like 
this:</pre>

      <p>When the app is running, you can see a preview version of your 
        site directly on your computer at this address:</p>

      <p><span class="link" data-href="http://localhost:1989/">localhost:1989</span></p>

      <p>Once you've got it the way you want it, you can send it to a free service to 
        make it available for world to see. See <span class="link" data-href="https://www.neopoligen.com/documentation">
          the documentation</span> for details on how to do that.</p>

      <h3>Content Files</h3>

      <p>Neopoligen keeps all the files that make up your site directly on 
      your computer. They're in a 'Neopoligen' folder under your main 'Documents' 
      folder. The app can make multiple sites so each one gets its own folder. When
      you first install the app, it makes a new site in the 'Example Site' folder
      which you can see here:</p>
