        still very much &quot;beta&quot; software. The basics are in place, but

        Neopoligen is a website builder. Its goal is to make 
        it as easy as possible for anyone to make a website for free. It
        works with files you write on your computer that look like this:

Getting Started With Neopoligen

Neopoligen is a website builder designed 
with the goal of making it as easy as 
possible for anyone to make their own 
website for free. It uses files you 
write on your computer that look like 
this:</pre>

      <p>When the app is running, you can see a preview version of your 
        site directly on your computer at this address:</p>

      <p><span class="link" data-href="http://localhost:1989/">localhost:1989</span></p>

      <p>Once you've got it the way you want it, you can send it to a free service to 
        make it available for world to see. See <span class="link" data-href="https://www.neopoligen.com/en/documentation/">
          the documentation</span> for details on how to do that.</p>

      <h3>Content Files</h3>

      <p>Neopoligen keeps your original content files directly on your computer. 
        They're in a &quot;Neopoligen&quot; folder under your main 'Documents' 
      folder. The app can make multiple sites so each one gets its own folder. When
      you first install the app, it makes a new site in the 'Example Site' folder
      which you can see here:</p>  

      <p><button data-command="open_neo_folder">Open Neopoligen Folder</button></p>

      <p>The initial contents of a site folder are:</p>
      
      <ul class="flow">
        <li>config.json file - Contains some basic details about the site. 
          (Details on the configuration can be found in the 
          <span class="link" data-href="https://www.neopoligen.com/en/documentation/">documentation</span>)
        </li>
        <li>configuration folder - This also holds some configuration items, but it's going away.
          Everything is moving into the config.json file
        </li>
        <li>content folder - This is where all the main content files that make 
          up your site go. The files all end with a <code>.neo</code> extension
          (if you can see those in your finder) which is the type of file
          that Neopoligen uses. 
        </li>
        <li>docs folder - This is where the files that make up the actual website
          are output when Neopoligen builds them. You don't need to mess with it, but 
          feel free to poke around to see what the output is. 
        </li>
        <li>images folder - For any images you want to include on your site. You can 
          organize images however you want inside this folder and then include
          them in on a page using just the name of the file. More details in
    <span class="link" data-href="https://www.neopoligen.com/en/documentation/">the documentation</span>)
        </li>
        <li>themes folder - Neopoligen works by combining your content files with a
          theme to build the site. This is where they are stored. 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Editing Files</h3>
      <p>Making content for Neopoligen sites is done by writing files
        in the &quot;content&quot; folder for a site that look like this:</p>

      <pre class="neo_source">-- title

An Example File

This is an example of what a content file 
looks like.


-- metadata
-- date: 2024-03-12
-- id: 2dbhvmfw</pre>

      <p>Eventually, Neopoligen will have an editor build into it. 
        For now, you'll need to use another app. I recommend 
        Visual Studio Code which you can <span class="link" data-href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">
          download here</span>. It's a free app that's primarily 
        used by programmers, but it works great for Neopoligen 
        too. Once you have it downloaded and installed, click this
        to open your Neopoligen folder in the app:
      </p>

      <div id="edit_in_vscode_button_wrapper"><button data-command="edit_in_vscode">Edit Site In Visual Studio Code</button></div>

      <p>When the app opens you'll see your Neopoligen folder and the 
      individual site folder it contains. If you just installed Neopoligen
        you'll see the &quot;Example-Site&quot; folder. Click <code>Example-Site</code> in the sidebar to expand that folder
        then click <code>content</code> to expand it where you'll see <code>home-page.neo</code> and <code>second-page.neo</code>.
        Finally, click the <code>home-page.neo</code> file to open it. 
      </p>

      <p>If you haven't already done so, open your browser to the site
        preview</p>

      <div id="open_browser_button_wrapper"><button data-command="open_browser">Preview Site In Browser</button></div>

      <p>You'll see the same content in the file on the web page. Now, try
        changing the "Neopoligen Example Site" to say something else and saving the file. When you do, 
      you'll see the page in the browser update with the changes as well.</p>

      <h3>Sections</h3>

      <p>Neopoligen files are based of <em>Sections</em>. Each one starts with two dashes (i.e. &quot;--&quot;)
        followed by the type of section and each one belong to a <em>Category</em> of section types
        that helps determine it's behaviour.

      </p>

      <p>The two sections we've seen so far are 
        <code>-- title</code> and <code>-- metadata</code>. The <em>title</em> section is part of
        the <em>Standard</em> category which generally outputs directly to the page. The <em>metadata</em>
        section is part of a category called <em>JSON</em>. Sections in the JSON category 
        don't show anything by default. They can be made to by applying a template, but
        we're not outputting anything for <em>metadata</em>. It's merely a way to pass
        the Date and the ID that Neopoligen uses for making links in the page.</p> 

      <h3>Section Attributes</h3>

      <p>The way that we're passing the Date and ID is with <em>Section Attributes</em> which
        are lines directly after the start of a section that also start with two dashes. The
        <em>metadata</em> section on the Example-Site home-page.neo example looks like this:
      </p>

      <pre class="neo_source">-- metadata
-- date: 2024-03-11
-- id: 2dwmgthu
-- path: /</pre>

      <p>The <em>-- metadata</em> line starts the section and the <em>-- date</em>, <em>-- id</em>, and <em>-- path</em> 
        lines are all attributes. (If you're wondering, the <em>-- path</em> attribute that has the <em>/</em> after
        it is what's used to identify the home page of the site. More details on that in the documentation.)</p>

      <p>The example theme doesn't do anything visible with those
        attributes but we can use the <em>-- title</em> section to see something change.
        Add a line with <code>-- class: green</code> underneath the <em>-- title</em> line so it
        looks like this:
      </p>

      <pre class="neo_source">-- title
-- class: green

Neopoligen Example Site</pre>

      <p>When you save the page you'll see green text show up in the browser.</p>

      <p>Adding a <em>-- class</em> attribute to a section tells it to change its
        formatting based of what are called <em>Stylesheets</em>. If you look in the
        folder:
      </p>

      <p><em>Example-Site / themes / example-site / _assets</em></p>

      <p>You'll see a file called</p>

      <p><em>styles.css</em></p>

      <p>If you click on <em>styles.css</em>in the sidebar of Visual Studio Code to open it 
        and scroll down some you'll see this snippet which is what does the color change:</p>

      <pre class="neo_source">.green {
  color: green;
}</pre>

      <p>The full name for the way styles work is called Cascading Style Sheets (or, CSS 
        for short). You can do <em>a lot</em> with them. If you're interested, you can
        get started learning more about them here: 
        <span class="link" data-href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics">
          CSS basics</span></p>

      <h3>Custom Section Attributes</h3>

      <p>Attributes can be used for more than just changing the style of a 
        section. They can also be used to send content to the templates for formatting. For example:
        add a <em>-- quote</em> section above the <em>-- metadata</em> section with something like:
      </p>


      <pre class="neo_source">-- quote 

Hello, World!
</pre>

      <p>When you save the file in Visual Studio Code it'll show up
        in the browser. In this case, the template that renders 
        quote sections in the theme has already applied a style that
        added the border to the quote. Now let's add some more
        formatted content with a <em>-- by</em> attribute like this:</p>


      <pre class="neo_source">-- quote 
-- by: Alan

Hello, World!
</pre>

      <p>When you save the file you'll see a new attribution show
        up under the quote. We can also add a <em>-- source</em>
        like:
      </p>

      <pre class="neo_source">-- quote 
-- by: Alan
-- source: The Internet

Hello, World!
</pre>

      <p>If you want to see how the template the theme is using to 
        output the quote it's in:</p>

      <p><em>Example-Site / themes / example-site / sections / quote / full / default.jinja </em></p>

      <p>There's more details on template and themes in the 
          <span class="link" data-href="https://www.neopoligen.com/en/documentation/">documentation</span> 
        if you'd like to experiment modifying one or making your own.</p>
        

    <h3>Spans</h3>

      <p>The last thing to know about to get started is <em>Spans</em>. They're used for 
        formatting content inside a section. For example, change the <em>Hello, world</em>
        in your quote to this:</p>

      <pre class="neo_source">Hello, &lt;&lt;strong|world&gt;&gt;</pre>

      <p>When you save the file the world &quot;world&quot; changes to bold on the 
        page</p>

      <p>You can add styles to spans as well. Try this:</pe>

      <pre class="neo_source">Hello, &lt;&lt;strong|world|class: green&gt;&gt;</pre>

      <p>Spans are also how linking is done. There's a <em>ilink</em> (for internal
        link) span that uses an ID to link between pages. For example, the
        <em>second-page.neo</em> file has an id of <em>2dwyp9ty</em>. You can use
        that to make a link to it from the <em>home-page.neo</em> file with:</p>


      <pre class="neo_source">&lt;&lt;ilink: 2dwyp9ty|Link To Second Page&gt;&gt;</pre>

      <h3>Next Steps</h3>

      <p>That's the basics. Like anything new, the ideas will take a some getting
      used to but I've tried to reduce the amount of gymnastics you'll need to 
        do to get started as much as possible. Check out 
        <span class="link" data-href="https://www.neopoligen.com/en/documentation/">the documentation</span>
        and especially
        <span class="link" data-href="https://www.neopoligen.com/en/cookbook/">the cookbook</span>. 
        I'll be adding lots more details there.
      </p> 

      <p>For now, I hope this app brings you the same joy I've had from making things on the web.</p>
