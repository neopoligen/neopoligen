        still very much &quot;beta&quot; software. The basics are in place, but
        there are missing features, cryptic error messages, and bugs of
        both the known and unknown variety.

        Neopoligen is a website builder. Its goal is to make 
        it as easy as possible for anyone to make a website for free. It
        works with files you write on your computer that look like this:

Getting Started With Neopoligen

Neopoligen is a website builder designed 
with the goal of making it as easy as 
possible for anyone to make their own 
website for free. It uses files you 
write on your computer that look like 
this:</pre>

      <p>When the app is running, you can see a preview version of your 
        site directly on your computer at this address:</p>

      <p><span class="link" data-href="http://localhost:1989/">localhost:1989</span></p>

      <p>Once you've got it the way you want it, you can send it to a free service to 
        make it available for world to see. See <span class="link" data-href="https://www.neopoligen.com/en/2dbdvgya/">
          the documentation</span> for details on how to do that.</p>

      <h3>Content Files</h3>

      <p>Neopoligen keeps your original content files directly on your computer. 
        They're in a &quot;Neopoligen&quot; folder under your main 'Documents' 
      folder. The app can make multiple sites so each one gets its own folder. When
      you first install the app, it makes a new site in the 'Example Site' folder
      which you can see here:</p>  

      <p><button data-command="open_neo_folder">Open Neopoligen Folder</button></p>

      <p>The initial contents of a site folder are:</p>
      
      <ul class="flow">
        <li>config.json file - Contains some basic details about the site. 
          (Details on the configuration can be found in the 
          <span class="link" data-href="https://www.neopoligen.com/en/2dbb3bkx/">documentation</span>)
        </li>
        <li>configuration folder - This also holds some configuration items, but it's going away.
          Everything is moving into the config.json file
        </li>
        <li>content folder - This is where all the main content files that make 
          up your site go. The files all end with a <code>.neo</code> extension
          (if you can see those in your finder) which is the type of file
          that Neopoligen uses. 
        </li>
        <li>docs folder - This is where the files that make up the actual website
          are output when Neopoligen builds them. You don't need to mess with it, but 
          feel free to poke around to see what the output is. 
        </li>
        <li>images folder - For any images you want to include on your site. You can 
          organize images however you want inside this folder and then include
          them in on a page using just the name of the file. More details:
          <span class="link" data-href="https://www.neopoligen.com/en/2dbboz0b/">images folder documentation</span>)
        </li>
        <li>themes folder - Neopoligen works by combining your content files with a
          theme to build the site. This is where they are stored. 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Editing Files</h3>
      <p>Making content for Neopoligen sites is done by writing files
        in the &quot;content&quot; folder for a site that look like this:</p>

      <pre class="neo_source">-- title

An Example File

This is an example of what a content file 
looks like.

      <p>Eventually, Neopoligen will have an editor build into it. 
        For now, you'll need to use another app. I recommend 
        Visual Studio Code which you can <span class="link" data-href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">
          download here</span>. It's a free app that's primarily 
        used by programmers, but it works great for Neopoligen 
        too. Once you have it downloaded and installed, click this
        to open your Neopoligen folder in the app:
      </p>

      <div id="edit_in_vscode_button_wrapper"><button data-command="edit_in_vscode">Edit Site In Visual Studio Code</button></div>

      <p>When the app opens you'll see your Neopoligen folder and the 
      individual site folder it contains. If you just installed Neopoligen
        you'll see the &quot;Example-Site&quot; folder.
      </p>
